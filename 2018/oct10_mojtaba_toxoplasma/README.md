# Oct. 10, 2018 Talk

I am giving a talk on my research project Toxoplasma which is a collaboration between department of computer science at the University of Georgia and the cell biology department at the University of Georgia and the cell biology department at the University of Vermont. There are two papers that are published in these projects, and another three are currently in our pipeline and estimated to submit them before next year. 

Regret to say that because of the large size of the PPT file, I could not be able to push it here, but the Google Drive link to that file is already mentioned in files list link.

One of the full papers is included in this repository (PDF). Moreover, a funny video link that introduces the T. gondii is mentioned to the files link inside the repository.
